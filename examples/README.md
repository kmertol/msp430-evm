# Examples

These examples are tested on MSP430F6725 using Code Composer Studio.

You can copy and paste the files directly to your project folder.

Since the event machine also needs some static configuration, I decided
to copy and paste the whole evm folder inside the example projects, rather
than using relative paths to the base evm folder.
