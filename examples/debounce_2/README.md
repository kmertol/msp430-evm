# (Not tested) A bit more than debouncing

This is a variation on the first debounce example.

* Selectable pull-up, pull-down modes
* Ability to define long press for inputs

**Considerations:**

In addition to the one timer for each defined input requirement, you will also
need one more if you have enabled long press mode for the corresponding input.
